This repo contains Alfred extensions that might be of use to others, they aren’t necessary very complex but some of them increase my productivity, allow me to do command line tricks without the hastle of typing out the full command or are just plain handy or entertaining.


Note that this is an overview of the content of this repo, further 
details ‘may’ be found in readme files who are included in the download.

Also note that this readme is outdated.

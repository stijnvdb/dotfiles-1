# Changing directories

  # If a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal command, and the command is the name of a directory,
  # perform the cd command to that directory.
  setopt autocd

  # Make cd push the old directory onto the directory stack.
  # setopt AUTO_PUSHD

  # If the argument to a cd command (or an implied cd with the AUTO_CD option set) is not a directory,
  # and does not begin with a slash, try to expand the expression as if it were preceded by a '~' (see the section 'Filename Expansion').
  setopt CDABLE_VARS

  # When changing to a directory containing a path segment '..' which would otherwise be treated as canceling the previous segment
  # in the path (in other words, 'foo/..' would be removed from the path, or if '..' is the first part of the path,
  # the last part of $PWD would be deleted), instead resolve the path to the physical directory. This option is overridden by CHASE_LINKS.
  # For example, suppose /foo/bar is a link to the directory /alt/rod. Without this option set, 'cd /foo/bar/..' changes to /foo; with it set,
  # it changes to /alt. The same applies if the current directory is /foo/bar and 'cd ..' is used.
  # Note that all other symbolic links in the path will also be resolved.
  # setopt CHASE_DOTS

  # Resolve symbolic links to their true values when changing directory. This also has the effect of CHASE_DOTS, i.e. a '..' path segment
  # will be treated as referring to the physical parent, even if the preceding path segment is a symbolic link.
  setopt CHASE_LINKS

  # Don't push multiple copies of the same directory onto the directory stack.
  setopt PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS

  # Exchanges the meanings of '+' and '-' when used with a number to specify a directory in the stack.
  # setopt PUSHD_MINUS

  # Do not print the directory stack after pushd or popd.
  # setopt PUSHD_SILENT

  # Have pushd with no arguments act like 'pushd $HOME'.
  # Set by default.
  # unsetopt PUSHD_TO_HOME

# Completion

  # If unset, key functions that list completions try to return to the last prompt if given a numeric argument.
  # If set these functions try to return to the last prompt if given no numeric argument.
  # Set by default.
  # unsetopt ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT

  # If a completion is performed with the cursor within a word, and a full completion is inserted, the cursor is moved to the end of the word.
  # That is, the cursor is moved to the end of the word if either a single match is inserted or menu completion is performed.
  setopt ALWAYS_TO_END

  # Automatically list choices on an ambiguous completion.
  # Set by default.
  # unsetopt AUTO_LIST

  # Automatically use menu completion after the second consecutive request for completion, for example by pressing the tab key repeatedly.
  # This option is overridden by MENU_COMPLETE.
  # Set by default.
  unsetopt AUTO_MENU

  # Any parameter that is set to the absolute name of a directory immediately becomes a name for that directory,
  # that will be used by the '%~' and related prompt sequences, and will be available when completion is performed on a word starting with '~'. (
  # Otherwise, the parameter must be used in the form '~param' first.)
  # setopt AUTO_NAME_DIRS

  # If a parameter name was completed and a following character (normally a space) automatically inserted,
  # and the next character typed is one of those that have to come directly after the name (like '}', ':', etc.),
  # the automatically added character is deleted, so that the character typed comes immediately after the parameter name.
  # Completion in a brace expansion is affected similarly: the added character is a ',', which will be removed if '}' is typed next.
  # Set by default.
  # unsetopt AUTO_PARAM_KEYS

  # If a parameter is completed whose content is the name of a directory, then add a trailing slash instead of a space.
  # Set by default.
  unsetopt AUTO_PARAM_SLASH

  # When the last character resulting from a completion is a slash and the next character typed is a word delimiter, a slash,
  # or a character that ends a command (such as a semicolon or an ampersand), remove the slash.
  # Set by default.
  # unsetopt AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH

  # On an ambiguous completion, automatically list choices when the completion function is called twice in succession.
  # This takes precedence over AUTO_LIST. The setting of LIST_AMBIGUOUS is respected. If AUTO_MENU is set,
  # the menu behaviour will then start with the third press. Note that this will not work with MENU_COMPLETE,
  # since repeated completion calls immediately cycle through the list in that case.
  # setopt BASH_AUTO_LIST

  # Prevents aliases on the command line from being internally substituted before completion is attempted.
  # The effect is to make the alias a distinct command for completion purposes.
  setopt COMPLETE_ALIASES

  # If unset, the cursor is set to the end of the word if completion is started. Otherwise it stays there and completion is done from both ends.
  unsetopt COMPLETE_IN_WORD

  # When the current word has a glob pattern, do not insert all the words resulting from the expansion but generate matches as for completion
  # and cycle through them like MENU_COMPLETE. The matches are generated as if a '*' was added to the end of the word,
  # or inserted at the cursor when COMPLETE_IN_WORD is set. This actually uses pattern matching, not globbing,
  # so it works not only for files but for any completion, such as options, user names, etc.
  # Note that when the pattern matcher is used, matching control (for example, case-insensitive or anchored matching) cannot be used.
  # This limitation only applies when the current word contains a pattern; simply turning on the GLOB_COMPLETE option does not have this effect.
  # setopt GLOB_COMPLETE

  # Whenever a command completion is attempted, make sure the entire command path is hashed first. This makes the first completion slower.
  # Set by default.
  # unsetopt HASH_LIST_ALL

  # This option works when AUTO_LIST or BASH_AUTO_LIST is also set. If there is an unambiguous prefix to insert on the command line,
  # that is done without a completion list being displayed; in other words, auto-listing behaviour only takes place when nothing would be inserted.
  # In the case of BASH_AUTO_LIST, this means that the list will be delayed to the third call of the function.
  # Set by default.
  # unsetopt LIST_AMBIGUOUS

  # Beep on an ambiguous completion. More accurately, this forces the completion widgets to return status 1 on an ambiguous completion,
  # which causes the shell to beep if the option BEEP is also set; this may be modified if completion is called from a user-defined widget.
  # Set by default.
  # unsetopt LIST_BEEP

  # Try to make the completion list smaller (occupying less lines) by printing the matches in columns with different widths.
  # setopt LIST_PACKED

  # Lay out the matches in completion lists sorted horizontally, that is, the second match is to the right of the first one, not under it as usual.
  # setopt LIST_ROWS_FIRST

  # When listing files that are possible completions, show the type of each file with a trailing identifying mark.
  # Set by default.
  # unsetopt LIST_TYPES

  # On an ambiguous completion, instead of listing possibilities or beeping, insert the first match immediately.
  # Then when completion is requested again, remove the first match and insert the second match, etc.
  # When there are no more matches, go back to the first one again. reverse-menu-complete may be used to loop through the list in the other direction.
  # Is option overrides AUTO_MENU.
  setopt MENU_COMPLETE

  # In completion, recognize exact matches even if they are ambiguous.
  setopt REC_EXACT

# Expansion and Globbing

  # If a pattern for filename generation is badly formed, print an error message. (If this option is unset, the pattern will be left unchanged.)
  setopt BAD_PATTERN

  # In a glob pattern, treat a trailing set of parentheses as a qualifier list, if it contains no '|', '(' or (if special) '~' characters.
  # See the section 'Filename Generation'.
  setopt BARE_GLOB_QUAL

  # Expand expressions in braces which would not otherwise undergo brace expansion to a lexically ordered list of all the characters.
  # See the section 'Brace Expansion'.
  # setopt BRACE_CCL

  # Make globbing (filename generation) sensitive to case. Note that other uses of patterns are always sensitive to case.
  # If the option is unset, the presence of any character which is special to filename generation will cause case-insensitive matching.
  # For example, cvs(/) can match the directory CVS owing to the presence of the globbing flag (unless the option BARE_GLOB_QUAL is unset).
  # Set by default.
  unsetopt CASE_GLOB

  # Make regular expressions using the zsh/regex module (including matches with =~) sensitive to case. On  by default.
  # unsetopt CASE_MATCH

  # If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, delete the pattern from the argument list;
  # do not report an error unless all the patterns in a command have no matches.
  # Overrides NOMATCH.
  # setopt CSH_NULL_GLOB

  # Perform = filename expansion. (See the section 'Filename Expansion'.)
  # setopt EQUALS

  # Treat the '#', '~' and '^' characters as part of patterns for filename generation, etc.
  # An initial unquoted '~' always produces named directory expansion.)
  # setopt EXTENDED_GLOB

  # Perform filename generation (globbing). (See the section 'Filename Generation'.) Set by default
  # unsetopt GLOB

  # If this option is set, filename generation (globbing) is performed on the right hand side of scalar parameter assignments of
  # the form 'name=pattern (e.g. 'foo=*'). If the result has more than one word the parameter will become an array with those words as arguments.
  # This option is provided for backwards compatibility only: globbing is always performed on the right hand side of array assignments of
  # the form 'name=(value)' (e.g. 'foo=(*)') and this form is recommended for clarity; with this option set, it is not possible to predict
  # whether the result will be an array or a scalar.
  # setopt GLOB_ASSIGN

  # Do not require a leading '.' in a filename to be matched explicitly.
  setopt GLOB_DOTS

  # Treat any characters resulting from parameter expansion as being eligible for file expansion and filename generation,
  # and any characters resulting from command substitution as being eligible for filename generation.
  # Braces (and commas in between) do not become eligible for expansion.
  # setopt GLOB_SUBST

  # Substitutions using the :s and :& history modifiers are performed with pattern matching instead of string matching.
  # This occurs wherever history modifiers are valid, including glob qualifiers and parameters.
  # See the section Modifiers in zshexp(1).
  # setopt HIST_SUBST_PATTERN

  # Do not perform brace expansion.
  # setopt IGNORE_BRACES

  # In pattern matching, the interpretation of parentheses is affected by a preceding '@', '*', '+', '?' or '!'.
  # See the section 'Filename Generation'.
  # setopt KSH_GLOB

  # All unquoted arguments of the form 'anything=expression' appearing after the command name have filename expansion
  # (that is, where expression has a leading '~' or '=') performed on expression as if it were a parameter assignment.
  # The argument is not otherwise treated specially; it is passed to the command as a single argument, and not used as
  # an actual parameter assignment. For example, in echo foo=~/bar:~/rod, both occurrences of ~ would be replaced.
  # Note that this happens anyway with typeset and similar statements. This option respects the setting of the KSH_TYPESET option.
  # In other words, if both options are in effect, arguments looking like assignments will not undergo word splitting.
  # setopt MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST

  # Append a trailing '/' to all directory names resulting from filename generation (globbing).
  setopt MARK_DIRS

  # Respect multibyte characters when found in strings. When this option is set, strings are examined using
  # the system library to determine how many bytes form a character, depending on the current locale.
  # This affects the way characters are counted in pattern matching, parameter values and various delimiters.
  # The option is Set by default if the shell was compiled with MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT except in sh emulation;
  # otherwise it is off by default and has no effect if turned on.
  # The mode is off in sh emulation for compatibility but for interactive use may need to be turned on if the terminal
  # interprets multibyte characters.If the option is off a single byte is always treated as a single character.
  # This setting is designed purely for examining strings known to contain raw bytes or other values that may not be characters in the current locale.
  # Is not necessary to unset the option merely because the character set for the current locale does not contain multibyte characters.
  # The option does not affect the shell's editor, which always uses the locale to determine multibyte characters.
  # This is because the character set displayed by the terminal emulator is independent of shell settings.
  # setopt MULTIBYTE

  # If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, print an error, instead of leaving it unchanged in the argument list.
  # This also applies to file expansion of an initial '~' or '='.
  # setopt NOMATCH

  # If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, delete the pattern from the argument list instead of reporting an error.
  # Overrides NOMATCH.
  # setopt NULL_GLOB

  # If numeric filenames are matched by a filename generation pattern, sort the filenames numerically rather than lexicographically.
  # setopt NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT

  # Array expansions of the form 'foo${xx}bar', where the parameter xx is set to (a b c), are substituted with 'fooabar foobbar foocbar'
  # instead of the default 'fooa b cbar'. Note that an empty array will therefore cause all arguments to be removed.
  # setopt RC_EXPAND_PARAM

  # If set, regular expression matching with the =~ operator will use Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions from the PCRE library, if available.
  # If not set, regular expressions will use the extended regexp syntax provided by the system libraries.
  # setopt REMATCH_PCRE

  # Disables the special meaning of '(', '|', ')' and '<' for globbing the result of parameter and command substitutions,
  # and in some other places where the shell accepts patterns. This option is set by default if zsh is invoked as sh or ksh.
  # setopt SH_GLOB

  # Treat unset parameters as if they were empty when substituting. Otherwise they are treated as an error.
  # setopt UNSET

  # Print a warning message when a global parameter is created in a function by an assignment.
  # This often indicates that a parameter has not been declared local when it should have been.
  # Parameters explicitly declared global from within a function using typeset -g do not cause a warning.
  # Note that there is no warning when a local parameter is assigned to in a nested function, which may also indicate an error.
  # setopt WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL

# History

  # If this is set, zsh sessions will append their history list to the history file, rather than replace it.
  # Thus, multiple parallel zsh sessions will all have the new entries from their history lists added to the history file,
  # in the order that they exit. The file will still be periodically re-written to trim it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond
  # the value specified by $SAVEHIST (see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).
  # Set by default.
  # unsetopt APPEND_HISTORY

  # Perform textual history expansion, csh-style, treating the character '!' specially.
  # setopt BANG_HIST

  # Save each command's beginning timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) and the duration (in seconds) to the history file.
  # The format of this prefixed data is: ':<beginning time>:<elapsed seconds>:<command>'.
  setopt EXTENDED_HISTORY

  # Add '|' to output redirections in the history. This allows history references to clobber files even when CLOBBER is unset.
  # setopt HIST_ALLOW_CLOBBER

  # Beep when an attempt is made to access a history entry which isn't there. Set by default.
  # unsetopt HIST_BEEP

  # If the internal history needs to be trimmed to add the current command line, setting this option will cause
  # the oldest history event that has a duplicate to be lost before losing a unique event from the list.
  # You should be sure to set the value of HISTSIZE to a larger number than SAVEHIST in order to give you some room for the duplicated events,
  # otherwise this option will behave just like HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS once the history fills up with unique events.
  setopt HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST

  # When writing out the history file, by default zsh uses ad-hoc file locking to avoid known problems with locking on some operating systems.
  # With this option locking is done by means of the system's fcntl call, where this method is available.
  # On recent operating systems this may provide better performance, in particular avoiding history corruption when files are stored on NFS.
  setopt HIST_FCNTL_LOCK

  # When searching for history entries in the line editor, do not display duplicates of a line previously found,
  # even if the duplicates are not contiguous.
  # setopt HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS

  # If a new command line being added to the history list duplicates an older one, the older command is removed from the list
  # (even if it is not the previous event).
  setopt HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS

  # Do not enter command lines into the history list if they are duplicates of the previous event.
  # setopt HIST_IGNORE_DUPS

  # Remove command lines from the history list when the first character on the line is a space, or when one of the expanded aliases
  # contains a leading space. Note that the command lingers in the internal history until the next command is entered before it vanishes,
  # allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the line. If you want to make it vanish right away without entering another command,
  # type a space and press return.
  setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE

  # Remove function definitions from the history list. Note that the function lingers in the internal history until the next command
  # is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the definition.
  # setopt HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS

  # Remove the history (fc -l) command from the history list when invoked. Note that the command lingers in the internal history until
  # the next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the line.
  # setopt HIST_NO_STORE

  # Remove superfluous blanks from each command line being added to the history list.
  setopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS

  # When the history file is re-written, we normally write out a copy of the file named $HISTFILE.new and then rename it over the old one.
  # However, if this option is unset, we instead truncate the old history file and write out the new version in-place.
  # If one of the history-appending options is enabled, this option only has an effect when the enlarged history file needs to be re-written
  # to trim it down to size. Disable this only if you have special needs, as doing so makes it possible to lose history entries if zsh gets
  # interrupted during the save. When writing out a copy of the history file, zsh preserves the old file's permissions and group information,
  # but will refuse to write out a new file if it would change the history file's owner.
  # Set by default.
  # unsetopt HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY

  # When writing out the history file, older commands that duplicate newer ones are omitted.
  setopt HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS

  # Whenever the user enters a line with history expansion, don't execute the line directly; instead, perform history expansion and
  # reload the line into the editing buffer.
  setopt HIST_VERIFY

  # This options works like APPEND_HISTORY except that new history lines are added to the $HISTFILE incrementally (as soon as they are entered),
  # rather than waiting until the shell exits. The file will still be periodically re-written to trim it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond
  # the value specified by $SAVEHIST (see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).
  setopt INC_APPEND_HISTORY

  # This option both imports new commands from the history file, and also causes your typed commands to be appended to the history file
  # (the latter is like specifying INC_APPEND_HISTORY). The history lines are also output with timestamps ala EXTENDED_HISTORY
  # (which makes it easier to find the spot where we left off reading the file after it gets re-written).
  # By default, history movement commands visit the imported lines as well as the local lines, but you can toggle this on and off with
  # the set-local-history zle binding. It is also possible to create a zle widget that will make some commands ignore imported commands,
  # and some include them. If you find that you want more control over when commands get imported, you may wish to turn SHARE_HISTORY off,
  # INC_APPEND_HISTORY on, and then manually import commands whenever you need them using 'fc -RI'.
  setopt SHARE_HISTORY

# Initialisation

  # All parameters subsequently defined are automatically exported.
  # setopt ALL_EXPORT

  # If this option is set, passing the -x flag to the builtins declare, float, integer, readonly and typeset (but not local) will also set
  # the -g flag; hence parameters exported to the environment will not be made local to the enclosing function, unless they were already or
  # the flag +g is given explicitly. If the option is unset, exported parameters will be made local in just the same way as any other parameter.
  # This option is set by default for backward compatibility; it is not recommended that its behaviour be relied upon.
  # Note that the builtin export always sets both the -x and -g flags, and hence its effect extends beyond the scope of the enclosing function;
  # this is the most portable way to achieve this behaviour.
  # setopt GLOBAL_EXPORT

  # If this option is unset, the startup files /etc/zprofile, /etc/zshrc, /etc/zlogin and /etc/zlogout will not be run.

  # unsetopt FLOW_CONTROL

  # Do not exit on end-of-file. Require the use of exit or logout instead. However, ten consecutive EOFs will cause the shell to exit anyway,

  # The behaviour is also disabled inside DEBUG traps. In this case the option is handled specially: it is unset on entry to the trap.
  # If the option DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set, as it is by default, and the option ERR_EXIT is found to have been set on exit, then the command
  # for which the DEBUG trap is being executed is skipped. The option is restored after the trap exits.
  # setopt ERR_EXIT

  # If a command has a non-zero exit status, return immediately from the enclosing function.
  # The logic is identical to that for ERR_EXIT, except that an implicit return statement is executed instead of an exit.
  # This will trigger an exit at the outermost level of a non-interactive script.
  # setopt ERR_RETURN

  # If set, line numbers of expressions evaluated using the builtin eval are tracked separately of the enclosing environment.
  # This applies both to the parameter LINENO and the line number output by the prompt escape %i.
  # If the option is set, the prompt escape %N will output the string '(eval)' instead of the script or function name as an indication.
  # (The two prompt escapes are typically used in the parameter PS4 to be output when the option XTRACE is set.)
  # If EVAL_LINENO is unset, the line number of the surrounding script or function is retained during the evaluation.
  # setopt EVAL_LINENO

  # Do execute commands. Without this option, commands are read and checked for syntax errors, but not executed.
  # This option cannot be turned off in an interactive shell, except when '-n' is supplied to the shell at startup.

  # When executing a shell function or sourcing a script, set $0 temporarily to the name of the function/script.
  # setopt FUNCTION_ARGZERO

  # If this option is set at the point of return from a shell function, most options (including this one) which were in
  # force upon entry to the function are restored; options that are not restored are PRIVILEGED and RESTRICTED.
  # Otherwise, only this option and the XTRACE and PRINT_EXIT_VALUE options are restored. Hence if this is explicitly unset by a
  # shell function the other options in force at the point of return will remain so. A shell function can also guarantee itself a
  # known shell configuration with a formulation like 'emulate -L zsh'; the -L activates LOCAL_OPTIONS.
  # setopt LOCAL_OPTIONS

  # If this option is set when a signal trap is set inside a function, then the previous status of the trap for that signal
  # will be restored when the function exits. Note that this option must be set prior to altering the trap behaviour in a function;
  # unlike LOCAL_OPTIONS, the value on exit from the function is irrelevant. However, it does not need to be set before any global
  # trap for that to be correctly restored by a function. For example,
    # `unsetopt localtraps`
    # `trap - INT`
    # `fn() { setopt localtraps; trap '' INT; sleep 3; }`
  # will restore normally handling of SIGINT after the function exits.
  # setopt LOCAL_TRAPS

  # Allow definitions of multiple functions at once in the form 'fn1 fn2...()'; if the option is not set, this causes a parse error.
  # Definition of multiple functions with the function keyword is always allowed. Multiple function definitions are not often used and
  # can cause obscure errors.

  # Interpret any integer constant beginning with a 0 as octal, per IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (ISO 9945-2:1993).
  # This is not enabled by default as it causes problems with parsing of, for example, date and time strings with leading zeroes.
  # Sequences of digits indicating a numeric base such as the '08' component in '08#77' are always interpreted as decimal, regardless of leading zeroes.
  # setopt OCTAL_ZEROES

  # If this is unset, executing any of the 'typeset' family of commands with no options and a list of parameters that have no values to be
  # assigned but already exist will display the value of the parameter. If the option is set, they will only be shown when parameters are
  # selected with the '-m' option. The option '-p' is available whether or not the option is set.

  # When set, matches performed with the =~ operator will set the BASH_REMATCH array variable,
  # instead of the default MATCH and match variables. The first element of the BASH_REMATCH array will contain
  # the entire matched text and subsequent elements will contain extracted substrings.
  # This option makes more sense when KSH_ARRAYS is also set, so that the entire matched portion is stored at
  # index 0 and the first substring is at index 1. Without this option, the MATCH variable contains the entire
  # matched text and the match array variable contains substrings.
  # setopt BASH_REMATCH


  # Make the echo builtin compatible with the BSD echo command.
  # This disables backslashed escape sequences in echo strings unless the -e option is specified.

  # A history reference without an event specifier will always refer to the previous command.
  # Without this option, such a history reference refers to the same event as the previous history reference, defaulting to the previous command.

  # Allow loop bodies to take the form 'list; end' instead of 'do list; done'.
  # setopt CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS

  # Changes the rules for single- and double-quoted text to match that of csh.
  # These require that embedded newlines be preceded by a backslash; unescaped newlines will cause an error message.
  # In double-quoted strings, it is made impossible to escape '$', ''' or '"' (and '\' itself no longer needs escaping).
  # Command substitutions are only expanded once, and cannot be nested.
  # setopt CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES

  # Do not use the values of NULLCMD and READNULLCMD when running redirections with no command.
  # This make such redirections fail (see the section 'Redirection').
  # setopt CSH_NULLCMD

  # Emulate ksh array handling as closely as possible. If this option is set, array elements are numbered from zero,
  # an array parameter without subscript refers to the first element instead of the whole array, and braces are required
  # to delimit a subscript ('${path[2]}' rather than just '$path[2]').
  # setopt KSH_ARRAYS

  # Emulate ksh function autoloading. This means that when a function is autoloaded, the corresponding file is merely executed,
  # and must define the function itself. (By default, the function is defined to the contents of the file. However,
  # the most common ksh-style case - of the file containing only a simple definition of the function - is always handled in the ksh-compatible manner.)
  # setopt KSH_AUTOLOAD

  # Alters the way options settings are printed: instead of separate lists of set and unset options, all options are shown,
  # marked 'on' if they are in the non-default state, 'off' otherwise.
  # setopt KSH_OPTION_PRINT

  # Alters the way arguments to the typeset family of commands, including declare, export, float, integer, local and readonly, are processed.
  # Without this option, zsh will perform normal word splitting after command and parameter expansion in arguments of an assignment;
  # with it, word splitting does not take place in those cases.
  # setopt KSH_TYPESET

  # Treat use of a subscript of value zero in array or string expressions as a reference to the first element, i.e. the element that usually
  # has the subscript 1. Ignored if KSH_ARRAYS is also set.
  # If neither this option nor KSH_ARRAYS is set, accesses to an element of an array or string with subscript zero return an empty
  # element or string, while attempts to set element zero of an array or string are treated as an error. However, attempts to set an
  # otherwise valid subscript range that includes zero will succeed. For example, if KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT is not set,
  # `array[0]=(element)` is an error, while `array[0,1]=(element)` is not and will replace the first element of the array.
  # This option is for compatibility with older versions of the shell and is not recommended in new code.
  # setopt KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT

  # When this option is set, reserved words are not candidates for alias expansion: it is still possible to declare any of them as an alias,
  # but the alias will never be expanded. Reserved words are described in the section RESERVED WORDS in zshmisc(1).
  # Alias expansion takes place while text is being read; hence when this option is set it does not take effect until the end of
  # any function or other piece of shell code parsed as one unit. Note this may cause differences from other shells even when the option is in effect.
  # For example, when running a command with 'zsh -c', or even 'zsh -o posixaliases -c', the entire command argument is parsed as one unit,
  # so aliases defined within the argument are not available even in later lines. If in doubt, avoid use of aliases in non-interactive code.
  # setopt POSIX_ALIASES

  # When this option is set the command builtin can be used to execute shell builtin commands.
  # Parameter assignments specified before shell functions and special builtins are kept after the command completes unless the special builtin is
  # prefixed with the command builtin.
  # Special builtins are ., :, break, continue, declare, eval, exit, export, integer, local, readonly, return, set, shift, source, times, trap and unset.
  # setopt POSIX_BUILTINS

  # When this option is set, only the ASCII characters a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9 and _ may be used in identifiers (names of shell parameters and modules).
  # When the option is unset and multibyte character support is enabled (i.e. it is compiled in and the option MULTIBYTE is set),
  # then additionally any alphanumeric characters in the local character set may be used in identifiers. Note that scripts and
  # functions written with this feature are not portable, and also that both options must be set before the script or function is parsed;
  # setting them during execution is not sufficient as the syntax variable=value has already been parsed as a command rather than an assignment.
  # If multibyte character support is not compiled into the shell this option is ignored; all octets with the top bit set may be used in identifiers.
  # This is non-standard but is the traditional zsh behaviour.
  # setopt POSIX_IDENTIFIERS

  # Perform filename expansion (e.g., ~ expansion) before parameter expansion, command substitution,
  # arithmetic expansion and brace expansion. If this option is unset, it is performed after brace expansion,
  # so things like '~$USERNAME' and '~{pfalstad,rc}' will work.
  # Set by default. @todo: check if actually set by default.
  # unsetopt SH_FILE_EXPANSION

  # Do not use the values of NULLCMD and READNULLCMD when doing redirections, use ':' instead (see the section 'Redirection').

  # This also affects the value of the - special parameter.

# Shell State

  # This is an interactive shell. This option is set upon initialisation if the standard input is a tty and commands
  # are being read from standard input. (See the discussion of SHIN_STDIN.) This heuristic may be overridden by specifying
  # a state for this option on the command line. The value of this option can only be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the shell.
  # It cannot be changed once zsh is running.
  # setopt INTERACTIVE

  # This is a login shell. If this option is not explicitly set, the shell is a login shell if
  # the first character of the argv[0] passed to the shell is a '-'.
  # setopt LOGIN

  # Turn on privileged mode. This is enabled automatically on startup if the effective user (group) ID is not equal to
  # the real user (group) ID. Turning this option off causes the effective user and group IDs to be set to the real user and group IDs.
  # This option disables sourcing user startup files. If zsh is invoked as 'sh' or 'ksh' with this option set, /
  # etc/suid_profile is sourced (after /etc/profile on interactive shells).
  # Sourcing ~/.profile is disabled and the contents of the ENV variable is ignored.
  # This option cannot be changed using the -m option of setopt and unsetopt, and changing it inside a function always changes it
  # globally regardless of the LOCAL_OPTIONS option.
  # setopt PRIVILEGED

  # Enables restricted mode. This option cannot be changed using unsetopt, and setting it inside a function always changes it globally
  # regardless of the LOCAL_OPTIONS option. See the section 'Restricted Shell'.
  # setopt RESTRICTED

  # Commands are being read from the standard input. Commands are read from standard input if no command is specified with -c and no
  # file of commands is specified. If SHIN_STDIN is set explicitly on the command line, any argument that would otherwise have been
  # taken as a file to run will instead be treated as a normal positional parameter.
  # Note that setting or unsetting this option on the command line does not necessarily affect the state the option will
  # have while the shell is running - that is purely an indicator of whether on not commands are actually being read from standard input.
  # The value of this option can only be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the shell.
  # It cannot be changed once zsh is running.
  # setopt SHIN_STDIN

  # If the shell is reading from standard input, it exits after a single command has been executed.
